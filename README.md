<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this React Native app built with Expo, I've developed a goal tracking application designed to help users set, monitor, and achieve their personal objectives. Leveraging Expo's simplicity, the app utilizes React Native components and Expo SDK features, offering a seamless cross-platform experience for both iOS and Android users. The technical aspects involve state management to track goal progress, intuitive user interfaces for goal creation, and notifications using Expo modules for timely reminders. With this application, users can easily organize and visualize their goals, fostering a productive and goal-oriented lifestyle.
